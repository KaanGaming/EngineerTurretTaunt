## Recommended Mods

* [Save Turrets From Underpopulation](https://thunderstore.io/package/Vegetableaux/Save_Turrets_From_Underpopulation/) - Gives the Engineer extra turrets per Lysate Cell, letting him stack turrets beyond 3 with at least one Lysate Cell in vanilla.
* [BadAssEmotes](https://thunderstore.io/package/MetrosexualFruitcake/BadAssEmotes/) and [TF2Emotes](https://thunderstore.io/package/MetrosexualFruitcake/TF2Emotes/) - mandatory for extra silliness
